            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Welcome! My name is Luke J. Miller, and I am a passionate PhD student specializing in Computer Science at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. With a distinguished 15-year career in strategic planning, team leadership, and adult instruction, I have dedicated my life to advancing the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing through innovative research and education.</p>

            <h2>Professional Background</h2>
            <p>I bring a strong academic foundation, having earned my Master of Science in Computer Science with a 3.96 GPA and completing coursework in areas such as Graph Neural Networks, Deep Learning, and Advanced Graph Theory. My professional journey has included impactful roles in academia, the Air Force, and industry, where I developed scalable machine learning solutions, taught thousands of students, and managed complex projects with excellence.</p>

            <h2>Family and Residence</h2>
            <p>I reside in Edgerton, Missouri, with my wife Sara Miller and our two children, Dylan and Benjamin. When Iâ€™m not immersed in research or teaching, I enjoy spending time with my family and exploring ways to make meaningful contributions to our community.</p>

            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>My current research focuses on enhancing the explainability of Graph Neural Networks and exploring the intersection of Quantum Computing and Artificial Intelligence. I aim to develop cutting-edge methods that address real-world challenges in scalability, efficiency, and performance.</p>

            <h2>Honors and Awards</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Instructor of the Year, Keesler AFB, 2016</li>
                <li>Magna Cum Laude, Bachelor of Science, Business Administration, Trident University, 2015</li>
                <li>Air Traffic Control Watch Supervisor of the Year, 2012</li>
                <li>Levitow Leadership Award, 2011</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Publications</h2>
            <p>One of my most notable publications is titled <em>"Detecting Pilot Task Saturation"</em>, presented at the AIAA SCITECH 2024 Forum. This work explores physiological markers of task saturation and the use of computer vision tools to enhance pilot safety.</p>
